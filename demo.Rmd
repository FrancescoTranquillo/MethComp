## Identity line and Bland-Altman plot

Thanks to the R Package "MethComp", it has been possible to compare every variable of interest. In the following pages are reported the plots of identity line and Bland-Altman referring to the comparison of the methods (DF-50 and Procyte Idexx)

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}

library(MethComp)

df<-read.csv("cani.csv", header = TRUE, sep = ";", dec= ",", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
df<-df[-c(393:396),]

for (i in c(4:25)) {
df_Meth<-Meth(df, 2,1,3,i)
df_Meth$meth<-factor(df_Meth$meth, levels=c("Procyte Idexx", "DF-50"))

plot(df_Meth)
title(main=list(colnames(df[i]), col="red"), line=3, adj=0.45)
}

```
